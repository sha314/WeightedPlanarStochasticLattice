The construction process of the WPSL can be described as follows.
It starts with a square of unit area which we regard as an initiator.
The generator then divides the initiator, in the first step,
randomly with uniform probability into four smaller blocks.
In the second step and thereafter, the generator is applied to only one of the blocks.
The question is: How do we pick that block when there is more than one block?
The most generic choice would be to pick preferentially according to their areas so that
the higher the area the higher the probability to be picked. For instance, in step one,
the generator divides the initiator randomly into four smaller blocks.
Let us label their areas starting from the top left corner and moving
clockwise as a_1 , a_2 , a_3  and a_4 . But of course the way we label is totally arbitrary
and will bear no consequence to the final results of any observable quantities.
Note that a_i is the area of the  i-th block  which can be well regarded as the probability
of picking the i-th block.   These probabilities are naturally  normalized
         sum_i a_i = 1
since we choose the area of the initiator equal to one.
In step two, we pick one of the four blocks preferentially with respect to their areas.
Consider that we pick the block 3 and apply the generator onto  it to divide it randomly
into four smaller blocks. Thus the label 3 is now redundant and hence we recycle it to label
the top left corner while the rest of three  new blocks are labelled a_5 , a_6 and a_7
in a clockwise fashion.   In general, in the j-th step,  we pick one out of
        (3*j âˆ’ 2)
blocks preferentially with respect to area and divide randomly into four blocks.
The detailed algorithm can be found in Dayeen and Hassan[1] and Hassan, Hassan, and Pavel.[2]



This process of lattice generation can also be described as follows.
Consider that the substrate is a square of unit area and at each
time step a seed is nucleated from which two orthogonal partitioning
lines parallel to the sides of the substrate are grown until intercepted by existing lines.
It results in partitioning the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks.
Note that the higher the area of a block, the higher is the probability
that the seed will be nucleated in it to divide that into four smaller blocks
since seeds are sown at random on the substrate.
It can also describes kinetics of fragmentation of two-dimensional objects.
